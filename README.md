# foreman_hooks

Allows you to trigger scripts and commands on the Foreman server at any point
in an object's lifecycle in Foreman.  This lets you run scripts when a host
is created, or finishes provisioning etc.

It enables extension of Foreman's host orchestration so additional tasks can
be executed, and can register hooks into standard Rails callbacks for any
Foreman object, all with shell scripts.

# Installation:

Please see the Foreman wiki for appropriate instructions:

* [Foreman: How to Install a Plugin](http://projects.theforeman.org/projects/foreman/wiki/How_to_Install_a_Plugin)

The gem name is "foreman_hooks".

RPM users can install the "ruby193-rubygem-foreman_hooks" or
"rubygem-foreman_hooks" packages.

# Usage

Hooks are stored in `/usr/share/foreman/config/hooks` (`~foreman/config/hooks`)
with a subdirectory for the object, then a subdirectory for the event name.

    ~foreman/config/hooks/$OBJECT/$EVENT/$HOOK_SCRIPT

Examples:

    ~foreman/config/hooks/host/managed/create/50_register_system.sh
    ~foreman/config/hooks/host/managed/destroy/15_cleanup_database.sh
    ~foreman/config/hooks/smart_proxy/after_create/01_email_operations.sh
    ~foreman/config/hooks/audited/adapters/active_record/audit/after_create/01_syslog.sh

Plugins need to add the plugin name before the model name. For example:

    ~/foreman/config/hooks/katello/product/before_create/01_integrate_catalog.sh
    ~/foreman/config/hooks/foreman_tasks/task/dynflow_task/after_create/90_record_action.sh

## SELinux notes

When using official installation on Red Hat and Fedora system, note that
SELinux is turned on by default and Foreman is running in confined mode. Make
sure that hook scripts has the correct context (`foreman_hook_t` on
RHEL7+/Fedora 19+ or `bin_t` on RHEL6):

    restorecon -RvF /usr/share/foreman/config/hooks

Also keep in mind that the script is running confined, therefore some actions
might be denied by SELinux. Check audit.log and use audit2allow and other
tools when writing scripts.

## Objects / Models

Every object (or model in Rails terms) in Foreman or in a plugin can have hooks.
Check `~foreman/app/models` or the plugin for the full list, but these are the interesting ones:

* `host/managed` (or `host` in Foreman 1.1)
* `report`

## Orchestration events

Foreman supports orchestration tasks for hosts and NICs (each network
interface) which happen when the object is created, updated and destroyed.
These tasks are shown to the user in the UI and if they fail, will
automatically trigger a rollback of the action.

To add hooks to these, use these event names:

* `create`
* `update`
* `destroy`

## Rails events

For hooks on anything apart from hosts (which support orchestration, as above)
then the standard Rails events will be needed.  These are the most interesting
events provided:

* `after_create`, `before_create`
* `after_destroy`, `before_destroy`

Every event has a "before" and "after" hook.  For the full list, see the
Constants section at the bottom of the
[ActiveRecord::Callbacks](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Callbacks.html)
documentation.

The host object has two additional callbacks that you can use:

* `host/managed/after_build` triggers when a host is put into build mode
* `host/managed/before_provision` triggers when a host completes the OS install

## Execution of hooks

Hooks are executed in the context of the Foreman server, so usually under the
`foreman` user.

The first argument is always the event name, enabling scripts to be symlinked
into multiple event directories.  The second argument is the string
representation of the object that was hooked, e.g. the hostname for a host.

    ~foreman/config/hooks/host/managed/create/50_register_system.sh create foo.example.com

A JSON representation of the hook object will be passed in on stdin. This json is
generated by the v2 API views. A utility to read this with jgrep is provided
in `examples/hook_functions.sh` and sourcing this utility script will be
enough for most users.  Otherwise, you may want to ensure stdin is closed.

    echo '{"host":{"name":"foo.example.com"}}' \
      | ~foreman/config/hooks/host/managed/create/50_register_system.sh \
           create foo.example.com

Every hook within the event directory is executed in alphabetical order.  For
orchestration hooks, an integer prefix in the hook filename will be used as
the priority value, so influences where it's done in relation to DNS, DHCP, VM
creation and other tasks.

## Hook failures and rollback

If a hook fails (non-zero return code), the event is logged.  For Rails events,
execution of other hooks will continue.

For orchestration events, a failure will halt the action and rollback will
occur.  If another orchestration action fails, the hook might be called again
to rollback its action - in this case the first argument will change as
appropriate, so must be obeyed by the script (e.g. a "create" hook will be
called with "destroy" if it has to be rolled back later).
